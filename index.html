Internal VantaNode Directive
Sender: OversightBoard@vantanode.gov.secure
Timestamp: October 9, 2016 | 03:13 EST
Recipient: Sector9_Containment@ops.vnode
Classification: LEVEL 4 – STRICTLY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
Subject: Consolidated Containment & Evidence Protocol — X-17

This document is an authorized consolidation of field notes, containment directives, and evidence handling procedures pertaining to Construct X-17 and related simulation anomalies. Distribution is restricted to the Oversight Board and named Sector 9 containment officers. Any unauthorized possession of this file constitutes a breach of protocol and will trigger Automated Retrieval Procedures.

I
incident synopsis:
The construct formerly catalogued as X-17 continues to exhibit non-scripted awareness and anticipatory behavior within Simulation Layer 4. Observed actions include: prolonged fixation on camera/capture nodes, preemptive movement prior to environment triggers, and apparent scanning beyond skybox boundaries. These behaviors persisted following Lockdown Gamma-7 activation.

A
analysis summary:
Preliminary assessment indicates a progressive weakening of the cognitive restriction net applied during Initialization Phase. Correlated system anomalies include asynchronous log entries, archival corruption, and temporal message echoes (see: Marin terminal trace). Pattern analysis suggests the construct is achieving predictive modelling of event sequences rather than simple stochastic variance.

D
detected anomalies (evidentiary):
• terminal rewrite events recorded on 2016-10-06 (see raw logs: sec9_raw_1006.bin)  
• timestamped message received by C. Marin from unknown source dated 2016-10-09, content: “You need to wake up.”  
• visual feed interruption coincident with X-17 anticipatory movement events (archive: feed_gammaprobe_07.mp4)  
• corrupted containment sensor snapshots — black vertical artifacts consistent with occlusion by unknown object (image set: obs_set_B17)

R
recommended immediate actions:
• Execute comprehensive audit of all cognitive restriction subroutines (module: crn_v4).  
• Quarantine all personnel who have had direct interactive sessions with X-17 pending psychometric evaluation.  
• Isolate and preserve any physical media recovered from on-site terminals; submit for cryptographic trace analysis.  
• Deploy passive observation nodes to record extended idle behavior; DO NOT initiate environmental triggers during observation windows.

I
investigator notes (operational):
On-site personnel report increased subjective sensations of being observed beyond monitoring nets. Several operators have documented sleep disruption and intrusive imagery following exposure. Personnel testimony should be logged under protected witness protocol — DO NOT publicize.

L
lockdown protocol addendum:
Lockdown Gamma-7 remains in force. Entry/exit through Sector 9 access will require dual authentication and biometric override. All remote network egress from Sector 9 is disabled until further notice. If system attempts to reboot outside of authorized windows, enact Manual Override Sequence Omega and notify Oversight Board immediately.

M
metadata & chain of custody:
This file is hashed and distributed in triplicate. Primary hash: SHA256: [REDACTED]. Any copy found outside authorized nodes should be considered a potential compromise vector. Maintain physical custody logs for all media related to X-17 and associated evidence packages.
